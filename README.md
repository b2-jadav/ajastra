# AJASTRA 🚛♻️  
**Optimized Waste Collection Routing System**

🔗 **GitHub Repository:**  
https://github.com/Team-Ajastra/AJASTRA.git



## 📌 Overview
AJASTRA is a prototype web-based system designed to optimize waste collection and transportation routes from **Garbage Vulnerable Points (GVPs)** to **Secondary Collection & Transfer Points (SCTPs)**.  
The project focuses on improving operational efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and enabling smarter waste logistics through optimized routing and visualization.



## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional waste collection systems often rely on static or manually planned routes, leading to inefficient fuel usage, delayed pickups, and higher operational costs.  
There is a need for an optimized routing model that can account for real-world operational parameters and generate efficient waste collection routes under varying conditions.



## 💡 Proposed Solution
AJASTRA provides an intelligent routing prototype that:
- Generates optimized routes for waste collection vehicles
- Supports multiple types of trucks (SATs and large trucks)
- Visualizes routes on an interactive map
- Presents data through a clean, modern dashboard interface

The system is designed to assist municipal authorities and waste management planners in making data-driven routing decisions.



## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ Optimized waste collection routes  
- ✅ Support for multiple truck types  
- ✅ Map-based route visualization  
- ✅ Interactive dashboard UI  
- ✅ OSRM-based routing engine integration  


## 🧠 Routing & Optimization
- Uses **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)** for route computation.
- Designed to handle real-world routing constraints and scalable for future enhancements.
